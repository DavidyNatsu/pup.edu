            <h2>Message from the Director</h2>
            <br>
            <p>Welcome to the Polytechnic University of the Philippines Mulanay Branch, the avenue of knowledge in the countryside.</p>
            <br>
            <p>PUP Mulanay serves as the conduit of the University to provide access to educational opportunities in the Bondoc Peninsula of Quezon Province which was once a depressed, disadvantaged, and underserved (DDU) area. Mulanay is on the threshold of development as an agri-based municipality and has the capability to become a trading center. Indeed, PUP Mulanay plays a vital role in educating the Filipino masses for rural development.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The opening of Open University (Pamantasang Bayan) in 1991 paved the establishment of PUP Mulanay in 1993 with the passage of RA 7645 or the General Appropriations Act of 1991 that provided Php5M capital outlay.</p>
            <br>
            <p>For nearly 20 years, it has continuously forged linkages with government and non-government organizations as well as private individuals and entitities to sustain its programs through scholarships and grants, infrastructure support, and extension services.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Be part of PUP Mulanay in pursuing your dreams and aspirations of uplifting your family through education. Join us in building the community and our country through genuine service to humanity!</p>

            <h2>History</h2>
            <br>
